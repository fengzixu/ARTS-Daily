# Algorithm

Try to re-practice algorithm problems. Although it is a simple problem, it consumes my so much time.
But I believe that if I can insist on practicing, I can do it faster and faster.

# Review 

In this week, I try to read articles about Kubernetes security issues, especially in CVE-2019-11246. That is a serious vulnerability with `kubectl cp` command. This is my first time to learn how to analyse a security problem. I also learned some new knowledge, such as Path Traversing, Symbol Link. Besides, I read Pull Requests about fixing this vulnerability and try to understand why we implemet like this.

# Tips

I didn't learn any new tips about technology. But I learned how to make grilled fish. :)

I spent a large amount of time to review knowledge about container technology, especially in the area related to Kubernetes. So I wrote this blog to re-organize the part of container technology in my knowledge network.
